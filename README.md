Spells from Metaprogramming Ruby

These 'spells' are handy recipes from the awesome book Metaprogramming Ruby
by Paolo Perrotta.  They are his work, not mine, but they are an excellent
reference and my goal with this repo is to have these spells in one place that
I may reference where ever I have internet.
